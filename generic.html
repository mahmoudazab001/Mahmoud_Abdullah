									<h1>Cyclistic Case Study<br />
									</h1>
									<p>In this case study, I analyze historical data from a Chicago based bike-share company in order to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. The main tools I use are spreadsheets, SQL and Tableau. Here are the highlights:<br />

									A more in-depth breakdown of the case study scenario is included below, followed by my full report.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/23-zillow-group-san-francisco-bike-storage-1-1515514321.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Scenario </h2>
								<p>Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two types of customers. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are known as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are known as members. Cyclistic's financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
									The marketing analytics team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The primary stakeholders for this project include Cyclistic's director of marketing and the Cyclistic executive team. The Cyclistic marketing analytics team are secondary stakeholders.
									</p>
								<h2>Defining the problem</h2>
								<p>The main problem for the director of marketing and marketing analytics team is this: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic's casual riders into annual members. There are three questions that will guide this future marketing program. For my scope on this project, I will analyze the first question:</p>
								1) How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?<br />
								2) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<p>
								3) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?</p>
								<p>By looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain patterns that are occurring in the two different groups. Understanding the differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted marketing for converting casual riders into members. For the Cyclistic executive team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members and will fuel future growth for the company.</p>
								<h2>Business task </h2>
								<p>Analyze historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.</p>
								<h2>Data sources</h2>
								<p>We'll be using Cyclistic's historical bike trip data from the last 12 months, which is publicly available <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here.</a>
								The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement">license.</a> The data is stored in spreadsheets. There are 12 files total:</p>
	<pre>
			1.	divvy_tripdata_202206
			2.	divvy_tripdata_202207
			3.	divvy_tripdata_202208
			4.	divvy_tripdata_202209
			5.	divvy_tripdata_202210
			6.	divvy_tripdata_202211
			7.	divvy_tripdata_202212
			8.	divvy_tripdata_202301
			9.	divvy_tripdata_202302
			10.	divvy_tripdata_202303
			11.	divvy_tripdata_202304
			12.	divvy_tripdata_202305
	</pre>
								<p>It is structured data, organized in rows (records) and columns (fields). Each record represents one trip, and each trip has a unique field that identifies it: ride_id . Each trip is anonymized and includes the following fields:</p>
    <pre>
		        * ride_id               #Ride id - unique
		        * rideable_type         #Bike type - Classic, Docked, Electric
			* started_at            #Trip start day and time
			* ended_at              #Trip end day and time
			* start_station_name    #Trip start station
			* start_station_id      #Trip start station id
			* end_station_name      #Trip end station
			* end_station_id        #Trip end station id
			* start_lat             #Trip start latitude  
			* start_lng             #Trip start longitute   
			* end_lat               #Trip end latitude  
			* end_lat               #Trip end longitute   
			* member_casual         #Rider type - Member or Casual 									
	</pre>
								<p>Bike station data that is made publicly available by the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html">city of Chicago</a> will also be used. 
									It can be downloaded <a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">here.</a>  In terms of bias and credibility, both data sources we are using ROCCC:</p>
								<p>•	Reliable and original: this is public data that contains accurate, complete and unbiased info on Cyclistic’s historical bike trips. It can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.</p>
								<p>•	Comprehensive and current: these sources contain all the data needed to understand the different ways members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. The data is from the past 12 months. It is current and relevant to the task at hand. This is important because the usefulness of data decreases as time passes.</p>
								<p>•	Cited: these sources are publicly available data provided by Cyclistic and the City of Chicago. Governmental agency data and vetted public data are typically good sources of data.</p>
								<h2>Data cleaning and manipulation</h2>
								<h2>Analysis #1: Exploratory</h2>
								<h2>Microsoft Excel: initial data cleaning and manipulation</h2>
								<p>Our next step is making sure the data is stored appropriately and prepared for analysis. After downloading all 12 zip files and unzipping them, I housed the files in a temporary folder on my desktop. I also renamed all the files to the appropriate naming format for easy reading and navigation between them as "divvy_tripdata_202206".</p>
								<p>	I started to explore each file (month) and took a closer look into the data to familiarize myself with the data, then I started to explore the data and check each column for any mistakes either typos or in the data type.</p>
								<p>	I 've created a new column calculating ride length and used it to filter the data and check it's integrity.</p>
								<p>	I found some rides which I have excluded it from the data before I have begun to analyze it such as:</p>
								<p>1.	some rides which had the end time of the ride before the start time of the ride.</p>
								<p>2.	other rides which had the same start and end time.</p>
								<p>3.	I also found trips with more than 24hr trip length so I excluded them to not affect with our analysis as they are unusual and represent about 0.2% of the total trips.</p>
								<p>	I checked for any duplication and deleted them.</p>
								<p>	 I've created a new column called "day_of_week" labeled from 1 to 7 as 1 = "Saturday" and 7 = "Friday".</p>
								<p>	I repeated these steps for all the files (month) of the previous year.</p>
								
								<h2>Further data cleaning and manipulation via SQL</h2>
								<p>As the files are very large to be handled in excel, I switched to SQL specifically Microsoft SQL server. firstly, I uploaded each file separately into its own table (while maintaining the original files as a backup).</p>
								<p>After uploading all 12 files into a custom dataset that I've created and renaming the tables to their appropriate naming I begin my journey into the data.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Table Content.jpg" alt="" style="width:236px;height:343px;"/></a>
								<p># Create full_year_data table</p>
								<p>I started to my analysis by grouping all the tables into one data for easy navigations and extracting data, also to make any change I want without affecting the original data.</p>

								<h2>Analysis #2: Summary</h2>
								<h2>full year - trends, relationships and insights</h2>
								<p>That's why we grouped all the files into one to visualize the entire year and discover the hidden trends, relationships and insight..<a href="https://github.com/mahmoudazab001/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Cyclistic_final.sql">Cyclistic . </a></p>
								<p>For a summary and overall visualization of my full year analysis, please visit the Tableau Public dashboard I created here: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mahmoud.abdullah/viz/CyclisticCaseStudy_16876079201840/Dashboard1">Cyclistic Dashboard . </a></p></p>
								<p> I will also highlight some of the interesting trends and relationships I discovered below.</p>
								<h2>Seasonal trends</h2>
								<p>Summer vs Winter</p>
								<a href="images/winter vs summer.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/winter vs summer.jpg" alt="" style="width:563px;height:380px;"/></a>
								<p>The busiest time of year for overall bike trips is (June, July, August). This makes sense because these months are mainly summer time. Bike riding is better suited for warmer weather, which is also why we see a major drop-off in total rides during the winter months (December, January, February).</p>
								<p>Annual members outnumbered casual riders in every season except Summer. Interestingly, the annual members nearly doubled the casual ridership in Winter and Spring while only slightly edging them out in Autumn.</p>
								<h2>Median ride length</h2>
								<p>We learned in the earlier quarterly analysis that the average ride length for casual riders was significantly impacted by outliers, so median is a more accurate measurement for our analysis:</p>
								<a href="images/median ride length.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/median ride length.jpg" alt="" style="width:559px;height:307px;"/></a>
								<p>We can see that casual riders consistently have longer rides than annual members.</p>
								<h2>Day of week</h2>
								<p>Which days of the week have the highest number of rides for casual riders vs annual members? Let's look at the mode for each quarter and for the full year:</p>
								<a href="images/day of week.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/day of week.jpg" alt="" style="width:858px;height:407px;"/></a>
								<p>Casual riders were extremely consistent, with Saturday revealing itself as their preferred day of week for each quarter and across the full year. Meanwhile, the annual members looked to favor the middle of the week for their bike use. The most popular day for them across the full year was Wednesday. </p>
								<h2>Bike type</h2>
								<p>Do members and casual riders have different preferences for bike type? Are classic bikes more popular than electric bikes?</p>
								<a href="images/bike type viz.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/bike type viz.jpg" alt="" style="width:758px;height:407px;"/></a>
								<p>We can clearly see that Electric bikes are the most type of bikes that people rent whether they were casual or member riders, followed by classic bikes.</p>
								<h2>Start and end station use</h2>
								<p>In the Tableau Dashboard I created, there is a worksheet that allows the exploration of start and end station use by members, casual riders and combined overall rides. The snapshot below is from the overall view. While interacting with the dashboard, we can see that casual riders have a higher max than annual members. Annual members have a lower max, but we can see more colors represented across the member map versus the consistent coloring across the casual map. This tells us that rides by members are more distributed across stations while rides by casual riders are more top heavy in that a huge chunk are happening at the same few stations.</p>
